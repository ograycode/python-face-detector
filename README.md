Face Detector
=============

This is part of the example up through chapter four of Joseph Howse's [OpenCV Computer Vision with Python](http://www.amazon.com/OpenCV-Computer-Vision-Python-Joseph/dp/1782163921/). I recommend you get a copy for a detailed explanation of every class and method, as well as a good read.

I put this up because the links provided in the book to download the source code did not work.
